# Claim–Evidence Analysis for Election Vulnerabilities
**[Download the full reference document (PDF)](claim-evidence_elections_v1.0.pdf)**  
This repository contains a reference text describing a structured approach for classifying
the evidentiary support for specific election-related claims.

The approach evaluates claims by matching them to clearly defined levels of evidentiary
support, from informal anomaly perception through demonstrated impact.
Its purpose is analytic discipline: to distinguish what is shown, what is plausible,
and what remains unproven.

The framework does not assess election legitimacy, intent, motive, or criminality.
It does not adjudicate truth or prescribe remedies.
Its sole function is to classify the evidentiary maturity of individual claims.

## What this is

- A **reference description** of a level-based claim–evidence analysis method  
- A **step-by-step procedure** for applying that method to real-world reports  
- **Worked examples** illustrating how claims stop at different levels depending on evidence  
- A **worksheet** for consistent, repeatable application

The unit of analysis is always a **claim**, which must be stated precisely.
Events, systems, and individuals are considered only insofar as they are referenced by the claim.

---

## What this is not

- Not a determination of election outcomes
- Not a theory of fraud or integrity
- Not an attribution or intent analysis
- Not a substitute for legal, investigative, or remedial processes

Assertions, explanations, or assurances—official or otherwise—do not advance a claim
unless supported by source evidence that satisfies the relevant level’s burden of proof.

## Structure

This repository is organized around three related but separable artifacts:

1. **Framework Reference**  
   Defines the conceptual structure, levels, and evidentiary burdens.

2. **Worked Examples**  
   Illustrative applications of the framework to specific claims.
   Examples may evolve independently but identify the framework version they align with.

3. **Worksheet**  
   An operational tool for analysts.
   The worksheet is expected to be edited or adapted and is versioned separately from the reference text.

---

## Use

The framework is intended for use by investigators, auditors, analysts, journalists,
and others evaluating election vulnerability claims of varying scope and severity.

Claims are evaluated independently.
Stopping at a lower level reflects evidentiary limits, not dismissal or endorsement.

---

## Versioning

Version identifiers are provided to support interpretive consistency.
They do not imply authority, endorsement, or governance.

There is no formal maintainer, review process, or adoption pathway.
The text may evolve as ambiguities are identified through use.
